In other words, a person is MPI poor if the person’s weighted deprivation score is equal to or higher than the poverty cutoff of 33.33%. Following the AF methodology, the MPI is calculated by multiplying the incidence of poverty (H) and the average intensity of poverty (A). More specifically, H is the proportion of the population that is multidimensionally poor, while A is the average proportion of dimensions in which poor people are deprived. So, MPI = H × A, reflecting both the share of people in poverty and the degree to which they are deprived."),
